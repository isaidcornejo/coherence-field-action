# coherence-action
This repository presents a Fisher–geometric action for isotropic empirical alignment on statistical manifolds. It introduces a scalar alignment field sourced by empirical Fisher deformation, derives its variational principle and field equation, and provides reproducible figures illustrating geometric screening and smoothing.
