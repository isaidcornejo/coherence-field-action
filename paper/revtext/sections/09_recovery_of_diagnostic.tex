The Poisson equation~\eqref{eq:PoissonEquation} ensures that $\phi$ coincides
with the empirical diagnostic only in a weak, distributional sense.
In regions where $A(\theta;q)$ varies slowly on the Fisher--Rao scale, the
alignment field tracks the local structure of the empirical deformation while
suppressing high-frequency geometric noise.

In this sense, the variational theory recovers the original diagnostic as a
local limit while extending it to a smooth, globally consistent geometric field.
