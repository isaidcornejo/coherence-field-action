We have constructed a minimal, reparametrization-invariant variational theory
describing isotropic empirical deformation of Fisher geometry on statistical
manifolds. By elevating a static alignment diagnostic to an auxiliary geometric
field, the framework embeds empirical mismatch within a principled mechanism
of geometric relaxation and smoothing.

The resulting theory is entirely fixed by Fisher--Rao geometry and introduces
no additional scales or structures. The alignment field satisfies a Poisson equation
on the statistical manifold, with empirical deformation acting as a geometric source.
Global consistency conditions and zero-mode structure replace the need for ad hoc
infrared regulators and admit a natural interpretation in terms of gauge fixing
and geometric normalization \cite{Rosenberg1997}.

The theory is intentionally restricted to the scalar (spin-0) sector, which may be
interpreted as the isotropic geometric pressure induced by empirical data. Anisotropic,
stress-like deformations correspond to higher-rank tensorial sectors that lie beyond
the scope of the present work but represent a natural direction for future research.

Within its domain of validity, the present construction provides a clean bridge
between information geometry, variational regularization, and classical geometric
field theory, offering a foundation that can be naturally connected to diffusion
processes, potential theory, and emergent physical descriptions on statistical
manifolds \cite{Amari2016,CoifmanLafon2006}. The \LaTeX{} source of this manuscript
