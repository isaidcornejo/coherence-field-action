Formally, solutions of Eq.~\eqref{eq:PoissonEquation} may be expressed in terms of the
Green function $\mathcal{G}(\theta,\theta')$ of the Laplace--Beltrami operator
\cite{Rosenberg1997},
\begin{equation}
-\Delta_G\,\mathcal{G}(\theta,\theta')
=
\frac{1}{\sqrt{\det G}}\delta(\theta-\theta'),
\end{equation}
subject to the chosen boundary or normalization conditions.

Here $\mathcal{G}(\theta,\theta')$ denotes the Green function of the
Laplace--Beltrami operator and should not be confused with the Fisher--Rao metric
\cite{Rosenberg1997}.

The alignment field then admits the representation
\begin{equation}
\phi(\theta)
=
\gamma
\int_{\ThetaMan}
\mathrm{d}^D\theta'\,
\sqrt{\det G(\theta')}
\,\mathcal{G}(\theta,\theta')\,A(\theta';q).
\end{equation}

This expression makes explicit that the alignment field is a
Fisher--geometrically weighted average of the empirical source.
The smoothing kernel is entirely determined by the intrinsic geometry of the
statistical manifold \cite{Rosenberg1997,Amari2016}.
